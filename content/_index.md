My name is Houston Haynes and I've been doing hardware and software engineering for a while now. I'm also a conservatory trained composer, so to the pun "F# Notes" for this site seemed to balance the nerd qualities of those two spheres. 🎵 😄 🔬 

While this site is based on Hugo and markdown, I'm also using the Obsidian note-taking app and the [zettlekasten](https://zettelkasten.de/) method to organize my thoughts. For those that already know about note-taking apps as "a second brain" this will come as no surprise. 🧠

## What is The Purpose of this Site?

 This is a clearinghouse for short-form and long-form notes along my personal path to deeper understanding of F#. Because of the incredible "reach" of F# - into front end, back end, machine learning and analytics, as well as its incredible capabilities as a meta-language, this site will venture pretty far and wide. In the early stages I'll be focusing on "core" F# idioms. But as subject 'fan our' there will be quite a bit about C# interop, as most of my current projects have quite a bit of crossover there.

### 'Tis The Gift To Be Simple 🎵

 (🎩 Hat tip to [Aaron Copland](https://www.youtube.com/watch?reload=9&v=JI6RYZygevA)) I'm not exactly certain how much of the "raw form" of zettles will actually show up here. I have a backlog of subjects I want to write about, but I'm also continuing practicing and learning new things every day. One of the aspects of this process that really "rings true" for me with the zettlekasten method is the ability to bring ideas together and allow them to coalesce in sometimes surprising ways. It *also* has some elements of a compositional approach to software engineering, something I'll be writing about more throughout the site. So while I want to avoid *over*-planning, that backlog of material is not trivial. But the end goal is to leave room for this site grow and foster an emergence of ideas - which cloud eventually lead to soliciting feedback and even including others as contributors to the repository for this site.

### A Paved Path 🛣️

 While this is about my own *second brain* hopefully this will also serve to help others in finding their own way to the variety of resources avaialble in this incredible ecosystem. For those that have recently discovered the treasure trove of open-source resources avaialble to them in the F# world 🗺️ it can seem a bit daunting. So aside from code samples and chatter of that sort I'll park references and "pointers" to other locations around the web, which is part of the super-power of "second brain" applications like these. 

## A Semblance of Direction

> 📚 Short Form Scatter: Zettles (note) will emerge as I stumble across new ideas while researching specific projects. The richness of markdown "frontmatter" and the graph visualizations available in this "book" format will help maintin those connections in the "Interactive Graph" that's part of this site format.
> ✏️ Emergent Structure: As zettles "mature" and gain more salience to on-going study, they'll eventually merge into longer-form blog entries. This is a little bit different from more "strict" zettlekasten impelmentations, where keeping notes small and focused is an almost dogmatic practice.
