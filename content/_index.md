My name is Houston Haynes and I've been doing hardware and software engineering for a while now. I'm also a conservatory trained composer, so to the pun "F# Notes" for this site seemed to balance the nerd qualities of those two spheres. 🎵 😄 📐

While this site is based on Hugo and markdown, I'm also using the Obsidian note-taking app and the [zettlekasten](https://zettelkasten.de/) method to organize my thoughts. For those that already know about note-taking apps as "a second brain" this will come as no surprise. 🧠

## What is The Purpose of this Site?

 This is a clearinghouse for short-form and long-form notes along my personal path to deeper understanding of F#. Because of the incredible "reach" of F# - into front end, back end, machine learning and Internet-of-Things, as well as its expansive capabilities as a *meta-language*, this site will have an increasing span as time marches on. In the early stages I'll be focusing on "core" F# idioms. But as subjects 'fan out' there will be some digressions to outline C# interop, as many of my current projects cross into that domain.

 And similarly, I will eventually delve into the [Fable](https://fable.io) compiler, which adds dimensions to F#. Outside of engineering circles which currently leverage the power of Fable it's *still* a relative unknown. But the fact that F# can compile to several other languages, starting with JavaScript, can provide type safety, performance, flexibility and __reach__ far beyond the .NET ecosystem.

## 'Tis The Gift To Be Simple 🎶

 (🎩 Hat tip to [Aaron Copland](https://www.youtube.com/watch?reload=9&v=JI6RYZygevA)) I'm not exactly certain how much of the "raw form" of zettles will actually show up here. I have a backlog of subjects I want to write about, but I'm also continuing practicing and learning new things every day. One of the aspects of this process that really rings true for me with the zettlekasten method is the ability to bring ideas together and allow them to coalesce in sometimes surprising ways. It *also* has some elements of a compositional approach to software engineering, something I'll be writing about more throughout the site. So while I want to avoid *over*-planning, that backlog of material is not trivial. But the end goal is to leave room for this site grow and foster an emergence of ideas - which could eventually lead to soliciting feedback and eventually include additional contributors at some point in the future.

## A Semblance of Direction

> 📚 __Short Form Scatter:__ Zettles (notes) will emerge as I stumble across new ideas while researching specific projects. The richness of markdown "frontmatter" and the graph visualizations available in this "book" format will help maintain those connections in the "Interactive Graph" that's part of this site format.

> ✏️ __Emergent Structure:__ As zettles "mature" and gain more salience to on-going study, they'll eventually merge into longer-form blog entries. This is a little bit different from more "strict" zettlekasten implementations, where keeping notes small and focused is a more strict, nearly dogmatic practice.

> 🔗 __Highly referenced:__ THis idea here is to provide *myself* with these reminders of references, in many cases to web resources, but in some cases to hard copy texts I keep on hand. I'll try to provide links to primary sources where possible. 

> ⚙️ __Working examples:__ One of the things I really want to have available is a way to exercise bits of code in the browser where possible. I'm not precisely sure how to do this now, but it *may* end up being one of the projects I list on this site. With [try.fsharp.org](try.fsharp.org) and [Fable REPL](https://fable.io/repl/) both available online I have to imagine that this should be a viable avenue to explore.


> 🕸️ __Interactive Graph:__ Probably the most eye-catching element of this site is the Interactive Graph available on most pages. This uses frontmatter to link pages together, and I expect that will start to build significantly as the zettlekasten and longer-form "perspective" pages start to intersect.

> 🌐 __Projects:__ There will also be project-specific folders and pages where I'll keep track of progress and document various sidebars and digressions.including others as contributors to the repository for this site.

## A Paved Path 🛣️

 While this is about my own *second brain* hopefully this will also serve to help others in finding their own way to the variety of resources available in this incredible ecosystem. For those that have recently discovered the treasure trove of open-source resources available to them in the F# world 🗺️ it can seem a bit daunting. So aside from code samples and chatter of that sort I'll park references and "pointers" to other locations around the web, which is part of the super-power of "second brain" applications like these.
