My name is Houston Haynes and I've been doing hardware and software engineering for a while now. I'm also a conservatory trained composer, so to the pun "F# Notes" for this site seemed to balance the nerd qualities of those two spheres. 🎵 😄 🔬 

For this site I'm using the Obsidian note-taking app and the [zettlekasten](https://zettelkasten.de/) method to organize my path to deeper understanding about the F# language and .NET ecosystem. For those that already know about note-taking apps as "a second brain" this will come as no surprise.

## What is The Purpose of this Site?

 This is a clearinghouse for short-form and long-form concepts around my approach to learning F#. While there will be some 'sausage making' going on in this site, I'm not exactly certain how much of the "short form" in zettlekasten would actually show up here. If you're interested in the method, you should definitely check it out. One of the things that really "rings true" for me with the method is the ability to bring ideas together and allow them to coalesce into something with more structure. So, I'm not sure if the purely *un*-structured notes will show up on this site. But the overall goal to to provide some "bradcrumbs" for myself and hopefully help others to see the variety of resources avaialble to them to learn more about this wonderful ecosystem.
