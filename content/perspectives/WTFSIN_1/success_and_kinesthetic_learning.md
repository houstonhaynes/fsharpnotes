## An Overnight Success Twenty Years in the Making

I really enjoyed watching these interviews with Don Syme, for the context as well as candor and humor he brings to the conversation. But I also liked the structure of the interview, where background info was displayed to "season" the screen as Don responded to questions.

It shows that F# may seem like a newcomer to certain fields, but that has more to do with *where* it can be deployed and the underpinnings supported by the .NET ecosystem more than F# itself. With .NET 6 Long Term Support and new tooling like .NET interactive, F# will compare favorably with a wide variety of general purpose and domain specific languages, and with that I expect adoption will increase across the board.

## Kinesthetic Learning

There's no substitute for learning while doing. But I'm also a reader. So I set up a large music stand in my home office with several books perched on it which I've started to refer as my "F# bookshelf". I'm currently working through Isaac Abraham's "Get Programming with F#" but I will thumb through others for reference and to occasionally provide a view into what's down the road. But the real work is sitting with the lessons and samples side-by-side in a working environment.

### Online Resources

Books often come with downloadable companion code - but there are also many free and paid online resources that facilitate the curious programmer's journey.

* [F# From the Ground Up](https://www.udemy.com/course/fsharp-from-the-ground-up/) (Kit Eason [Udemy paid courseware - highly recommended])
* [F# for Fun and Profit](https://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/) (Scott Wlaschin's site)
* [Compositional IT News & Blog](https://www.compositional-it.com/news-blog/) (company founded by Isaac Abraham)
* [Learning F#](https://fsharp.org/learn/) (F# Foundation's compendium)
* [Functional koans in F#](https://github.com/ChrisMarinos/FSharpKoans") (Chris Marinos on GitHub)

There are many standard-bearers for F#, and they offer long-standing and substantial bodies of work to help software engineers approach regardless of their technical background.
